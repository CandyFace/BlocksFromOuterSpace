BlocksFromOuterSpace
====================

A small infinite runner made in unity.
I'm not sure wether i'll do much more with it, so i decided to share it.
it was originally intended to be a REALLY barebone runner "game" which we had to do at my university.. but then i took it a bit further than that
and added various stuff.

The game features:
  - infinitely spawning platforms at random positions
  - COLORS
  - MORE FANCY COLORS
  - A delightful space background
  - Music from IndieGameMusic.com

Requirements:
  - Unity version 4.5
